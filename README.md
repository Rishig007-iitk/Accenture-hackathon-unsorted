## What is BusinessIntelligence.ai?

**BusinessIntelligence.ai** is an AI-powered enterprise intelligence system that solves a fundamental problem in modern business: Dashboards only tell you *what* happened, not *why* it happened or *what to do about it*. 

When a critical metric drops, traditional business intelligence requires a team of analysts to spend 3-5 days manually pulling data from Sales, Supply Chain, and Marketing silos to figure out the root cause. 

**This engine collapses that 3-5 day manual triage process into under 10 seconds.** It uses deterministic math to find the exact root cause, and then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to write a persona-adapted briefing and recommend governed actions.

## The Three Problems We Solve

1. **Dashboard Paralysis:** Traditional BI tools (like Tableau or PowerBI) show a red chart but leave the user to figure out the "Why".
2. **"Hallucinating" AI:** When you ask ChatGPT to analyze raw financial data, it often hallucinates numbers, losing the trust of finance teams immediately.
3. **The Insight-to-Action Gap:** Even when insights are found, they lack a clear owner, a specific action plan, and a confidence score.

## Our Solution: The 5-Layer Hybrid Architecture

We solved the hallucination problem by creating a strict boundary between **Math** and **Storytelling**.

1. **Layer 1: The Semantic Contract** (`contracts/semantic_contract.json`)
   A single JSON "constitution" that defines every KPI formula, data source, alert threshold, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rule. This guarantees that every department is calculating metrics exactly the same way.

2. **Layer 2: Deterministic Analytics Engine** (`engine/deterministic_analytics.js`)
   **100% Math. Zero AI guessing.** This layer ingests data from POS, ERP, and CRM systems, calculates current KPI values, and performs a mathematically perfect "Waterfall Decomposition" to identify exactly which drivers caused a metric to move (e.g., -210 bps from Promotions, -170 bps from Freight).

3. **Layer 3: Action Recommender Engine** (`engine/action_recommender.js`)
   Maps the mathematical root causes to specific, governed business actions. It assigns an owner, defines the expected financial impact, and calculates a Confidence Score.

4. **Layer 4: Persona-Adaptive LLM Synthesizer** (`engine/llm_synthesizer.js`)
   The LLM (Gemini or GPT-4) receives the *pre-calculated, verified numbers* from the engine. It is strictly instructed **not to calculate anything**. It simply writes a human-readable narrative tailored to the user (e.g., strategic for a VP, tactical for a Regional Manager). 

5. **Layer 5: Interactive Decision Workspace** (`js/app.js` & `index.html`)
   A front-end interface featuring dynamic KPI cards, a waterfall chart, actionable recommendations, mathematical evidence/data lineage, and real-time inference telemetry.

## 📊 The 4 Interactive Scenarios

The prototype features 4 clickable scenarios demonstrating the engine's capabilities:

- **Scenario 1: Multi-Factor Margin Squeeze**
  Demonstrates how the engine decomposes a complex -380 bps margin drop into specific components (high promotions + spiked freight costs) and recommends targeted recovery actions.

- **Scenario 2: Data Contradiction & Explicit Abstention**
  Shows what happens when POS store scanners report 0 stock, but central ERP systems report 14,200 units. Because the data contradicts, the engine's confidence drops below 60%. **It explicitly ABSTAINS from taking action** and asks a human to audit the discrepancy, preventing a $60k mistaken inventory order.

- **Scenario 3: Sparse History / Cold-Start**
  A new product launched 8 days ago doesn't have enough history for standard anomaly detection. The engine seamlessly swaps to a **Bayesian Prior** based on category benchmarks, displaying a wider uncertainty interval (±18.5%) and recommending patience.

- **Scenario 4: Role-Based Security (RBAC) & Data Masking**
  Shows how the system filters data based on the logged-in user. When viewed as a Regional Manager, enterprise-wide margin data is cryptographically masked, the waterfall chart is locked, and recommendations are restricted to local operational levers.

## How to Run Locally

Because this prototype utilizes JavaScript ES Modules (`import`/`export`) and local `fetch` calls to load the JSON data, **it cannot be run by simply double-clicking `index.html`**. Your browser will block it due to strict CORS/file protocol security.

You must run it through a local development server.

### Method 1: Using Python (Recommended)
If you have Python installed, open your terminal in this repository's folder and run:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`

### Method 2: Using Node.js
If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `serve` package:
```bash
npx serve .
```

### Using the Live LLM Feature
1. On the initial "Ingest Enterprise Data" screen, you can provide an optional **Gemini API Key**.
2. If provided, the engine will make live calls to `gemini-1.5-flash` to synthesize the narratives dynamically!
3. If no key is provided, don't worry—the engine gracefully falls back to high-quality local mock responses so you can still experience the full flow of the demo.

## Why This Wins

- **Zero Hallucinations:** By separating the math from the LLM, we guarantee 100% financial accuracy.
- **Enterprise Ready:** Features like RBAC data masking, data freshness validation, and the "Abstention" safety protocol make this ready for real-world corporate environments.
- **Incredible ROI:** Analyzes cross-silo data for fractions of a penny ($0.0012 per insight) in ~530ms, replacing days of manual analyst work.
